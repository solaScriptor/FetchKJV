**FetchKJV**



FetchKJV is a lightweight Windows tool that instantly retrieves and displays full King James Version (KJV) Bible passages from any highlighted reference.



✨ Features

\- Instant verse lookup

Highlight any Bible reference (e.g., John 3:16–18) and press your hotkey to open a clean, scrollable popup with the full KJV text.

\- Smart two‑press workflow

First press: show the passage

Second press: copy clean, formatted text (with or without references)

\- RTF clipboard support

Copies verses with italics preserved, ready for Word, PowerPoint, or sermon notes.

\- Hover‑aware popup

The window stays open while your mouse is over it and closes automatically after a short delay when you move away.

\- Lightweight and offline‑ready

Loads the entire KJV locally for instant access with no internet required.
